# ProjectGlove
[![Build status](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/4fdd24e9-ded2-4464-9203-6277e52ca1cf/branches/master/badge)](https://appcenter.ms)
## What is ProjectGlove?
At this point, ProjectGlove is a placeholder name; I have not decided what to name this. What it does reflect, however, is an app developed in Xamarin.
## What's the app going to do?
It's going to serve as a Discord bot generator. The idea is to leverage the development process of creating a Discord bot to the user's requirements, without the user having to rely on any programming knowledge what-so-ever.
## Okay, you lost me, what on earth is Discord?
Discord is an "All-in-one voice and text chat for gamers that's free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone", very similar to Skype and Teamspeak.
## Are you going to support [INSERT PLATFORM HERE]?
The first stable and shippable build of this app will be developed in Android. Once released, plans for iOS and UWP will commence development. This is also the reason why I pre-emptively decided to go with Xamarin as a framework, because compatibility on every platform is an important feature on any app.
## What will the bots do?
As much as possible (hopefully). This is the kind of functionality that I hope will allow me to continuously develop this app, as people's requirements and demands change for what they want in a bot, so will mine.
## Awesome! How do I use it?
Right now, you can't. There are no released builds of this project.
